# SmallProblems
All code written 100% by me. AI was only used to come up with the problem and test cases, not to write the solution.

In each file, at the top there is a block comment with the prompt with all the details needed to solve the problem.

The main function only initializes and calls test cases.

The solution is written in all other functions.
